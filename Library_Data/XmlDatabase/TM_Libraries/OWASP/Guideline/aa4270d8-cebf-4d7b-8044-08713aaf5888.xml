    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1><p>Use SSL only for pages that require it. </p><h1>Why</h1><p>Using SSL is expensive in terms of performance. </p><h1>When</h1><p>Use SSL for pages that contain or capture sensitive data, such as pages that accept credit card numbers and passwords. Use SSL only if the following conditions are true: </p><ul><li>You want to encrypt the page data. </li><li>You want to guarantee that the server to which you send the data is the server that you expect. </li></ul><h1>How</h1><p>For pages where you must use SSL, follow these guidelines: </p><ul><li>Make the page size as small as possible. </li><li>Avoid using graphics that have large file sizes. If you use graphics, use graphics that have smaller file sizes and resolution. Or, use graphics from a site that is not secure. However, when you use graphics from a site that is not secure, Web browsers display a dialog box that asks the user if the user wants to display the content from the site that is not secure. </li></ul><h1>Related Items</h1><ul><li><a href="ruledisplay:ecfc4c67-2a6c-443e-844e-8a3051fe54f3">Use IPSsec to Encrypt Traffic Between Servers</a></li><li><a href="ruledisplay:de1299b9-854b-4479-9f26-bbc9df38af29">Use SSL or IPSec for Secure Communication Between Entities</a></li><li><a href="ruledisplay:00b37bcb-5a47-41ca-9e84-a9e8edb15272">Use SSL Between the Web Browser and Web Server When Pages Need to be Encrypted<br></a></li></ul><hr><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </p>]]></Data>
